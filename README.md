<p>Community Science Museum Oslo is an incredible museum situated in the center of Oslo, and the home page serves to spread that message to the public.</p>
<p>The amount of incredible information found within the walls of the CSMO is quite astounding, far away from the notion some youth might have of boring, time-consuming visits to museums. So the web page aims to break the idea of museums being boring, by being playful, inspirational, and surrealistic yet based on reality.</p>

<p>As you'll discover browsing the web page, all CTAs do lead, directly or indirectly, to encourage the person to visit the museum physically. Which is also the purpose of the web page: To be a magnet for the museum itself.</p>

<h2>Contributing:</h2>
<p>In order to contribute to this project, kindly share your thought process as you develop and / or design, with due explanation to your thought process, and documentation for your technical work where necessary. However, if the design and code is self-evident, which is the ideal, you don't have to document just for the sake of it. Keep it neat and clean, and remember that simple is better more often than not.</p>
<p>The idea behind the blog is to break the notion of museums being boring, and to envoke emotions of playfulness, fun and energy in the visitors. Both to attract youth as well as older people. So while contributing to this project, please keep in mind the playful nature of the site, awe-inspiring scientific advances, and how magic appears in the intersection between reality and science, when traveling towards the borders of our known world.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements from Johan Lossius:</h2>
<p>I'd like to acknowledge Noroff for providing me with a great and flexible study so that I can keep learning while being busy with my own company. What I particularly liked was the pragmatism of the study, free from inapplicable theory that has no other use than to kill creativity, and full of pragmatic tools, tricks and knowledge to be used in the field of frontend development and design.</p>
<p>Also I'd liked to acknowledge the tutors that have helped me along, grading my work and providing feedback and tips when necessary.</p>
